# Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
Computer vision (CV) is the scientific field which defines how machines interpret the meaning of images and videos. Computer vision algorithms analyze certain image and video criteria and then apply interpretations to predictive or decision-making tasks.

# ◈ Canny Edge Detection
Canny edge detection is a technique to extract useful structural information from different vision objects and dramatically reduce the amount of data to be processed. It has been widely applied in various computer vision systems.
The Canny edge detection algorithm is composed of 5 steps:
‣ Noise reduction
‣ Gradient calculation
‣ Non-maximum suppression
‣ Double threshold
‣ Edge Tracking by Hysteresis

# ◈ Grey Wolf Optimization for Coronary Artery Disease
Cardiovascular disease has been declared one of the deadly illnesses that affect humans in the Middle and Old Ages across the globe. One of the cardiovascular diseases known as Coronary artery has recorded the highest number of motility rates in recent years. Machine learning tools have been very effective in investigating the causes of such lethal diseases which involve analyzing large amounts of data.
In the first stage, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is used to find the best features in the disease identification dataset. In the second stage, the fitness function of GWO is evaluated using a Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM). The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset is used for performance validation of the proposed method.

# ◈ Harris Corner Detection
The Harris corner detector is a corner detection operator that is commonly used in computer vision algorithms to extract corners and infer features of an image. It was first introduced by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988 upon the improvement of Moravec's corner detector.
The basic intuition behind the Harris Detector is that sliding a small window over the image causes a gradual change in different directions. This can be used to detect corners as shifting the window in any direction will result in a large change.

# ◈ Histogram Equalization
Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram. Histogram equalization is a widely used contrast-enhancement technique in image processing because of its high eﬃciency and simplicity. It is one of the sophisticated methods for modifying the dynamic range and contrast of an image by altering that image such that its intensity histogram has the desired shape.

# ◈ Image Segmentation Region-based
A region in an image can be defined by its border (edge) or its interior, and the two representations are equal. Region-based segmentation involves dividing an image into regions with similar characteristics. Each region is a group of pixels, which the algorithm locates via a seed point. Once the algorithm finds the seed points, it can grow regions by adding more pixels or shrinking and merging them with other points.

# ◈ OpenCV
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision. OpenCV is a Python library that allows you to perform image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides a wide range of features, including object detection, face recognition, and tracking. In this OpenCV Tutorial in Python, we'll be learning more about the library.

# ◈ Yolov8
A new state-of-the-art in computer vision, supporting object detection, classification, and segmentation tasks. YOLOv8 model The backbone of YOLOv8 primarily comprises the C2f module inspired by the ELAN module. The architecture of the C2f module integrates two parallel gradient flow branches, facilitating a more robust gradient information flow.
YOLOv8 models are fast, accurate, and easy to use, making them ideal for various object detection and image segmentation tasks. They can be trained on large datasets and run on diverse hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs.
